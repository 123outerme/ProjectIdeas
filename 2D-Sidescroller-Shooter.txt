Core Mechanics:
*Timesaving "cancels" which reduce lag on jumps, landing, turning, etc. while shooting
**Think Falco lasers in Melee: jump-cancelling to have no lag on landing
**Cancels maybe include crouch-cancels, jump-cancels, turnaround-cancels, shoot-cancels, swap-cancels, etc.

*Guns/whatever will shoot have different types with different lag stages. You can do different techniques to cancel the lag, ensuring a bullet storm is produced
**Autos have no lag in shooting, but lag in reloading
**Shotguns have lag in shooting, but less in reloading
**Snipers have both, but are high-power, explosive, etc.
**Others
