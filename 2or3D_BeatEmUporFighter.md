# Core Mechanics:
* Faster speed == higher damage (boost damage by making fists/self move faster, for example)
* Some attacks make you move faster, some slow you down after completed
* Endless runner? I don't want to do that

## Other Gameplay:
* Customize character to balance speed
* Towards the upper region of speed, physics start getting a little weird (on purpose)

# Story:
* n/a?

# Art:
* Lots of red/blue/green streaks across the screen, as you get fast enough it turns white
* Dim towards the beginning

# Sound:
* 

# Name Brainstorming:
* Warp (Speed)
* Light
* C, speed of light
* Dash
* Brawl
* Crash
* Smash
